# Why Docker
As a Data Scientist, at average 3 hours a week I waste my time on fixing the model deployment in production systems ,system configuration issues, memory, library dependencies, not compatible packages, package not found and many more issues due to the
diffrences in hardware/software/security policies.

There comes the Docker!!

Docker is a way to isolate a process from the system on which it is running. It allows us to isolate the code written to define an application and the resources required to run that application from the hardware on which it runs using **containerization**

## Docker Is Not a Virtual Machine
A Virtual Machine is made up of user space plus kernel space of an operating system. Under VMs, server hardware is virtualized. Each VM has Operating system (OS) & apps. It shares hardware resource from the host.

Docker is container based technology and containers are just user space of the operating system. At the low level, a container is just a set of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system, running from a distinct image that provides all files necessary to support the processes. It is built for running applications. In Docker, the containers running share the host OS kernel.

In VM environment, each workload needs a complete OS. But with a container environment, multiple workloads can run with 1 OS.

## Getting started

To check that everything is set-up, run the following:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker run hello-world
```
### Pulling an Image

Lets start running our first container. Here we will run an ubuntu container, and run few docker commands.
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker pull ubuntu
```
pull command fetches the latest ubuntu image from the **Dockerhub** a repository for hosting built dockers.



Some basic text

Some *italics*

Some **bold** text.

Here's a bulleted list:

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x,y):
        z = np.sum(x,y)
        return x
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```
Here's some inline code `x+y`

Here's an image

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

you can also put in inline $$z=x+y$$
