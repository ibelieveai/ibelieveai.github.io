## Problem with traditional Neural Networks or Multi Layer Perceptrons

Every image is an arrangement of dots (a pixel) arranged in a special order. If you change the order or color of a pixel, the image would change as well. Let us take an example. Let us say, you wanted to store and read an image with a number 4 written on it.The machine will basically break this image into a matrix of pixels and store the color code for each pixel at the representative location. 

here is how machine looks at a hand written image.

A fully connected network would take this image as an array by flattening it and considering pixel values as features to predict the number in image.

The problem with this approach are
*   **Not enough computational power**
As machine see an image as a matrix of numbers where each number corresponds to the pixel value. An image of size 256 x 256 x 3 is a matrix with 3 layers (RGB) where each layer contains 256 x 256 values.

When we flatten these values in to a vector and feed into a network we are feeding 196,608 inputs.If, for example, we have 1,000 hidden units in our first hidden layer, there would be approximately 196 million parameters or weights for us to train which is infeasible.

*   **Local Features Loss**
With images, you normally do want to preserve the local features. What we mean by this is if you want to classify a cat, we would like to preserve the key features such as the face or ears of the cat. However, by flattening the matrix, we have removed all those local features which is not a good approach. Even with these obstacles, people have invented a new way to solve these problems with the technique which is known as **convolution**.
