# Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: DenseNet

Convolutional Neural Networks are the popular choice of neural networks for different Computer Vision tasks such as image recognition.
The problems arise with CNNs when they go deeper. This is because the path for information from the input layer until the output layer (and for the gradient in the opposite direction) becomes so big, that they can get vanished before reaching the other side.
